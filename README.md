# Spotify Controller

Still looking for a sexier name.

Control your Spotify Player from the terminal.

Based on [BelkaDev's](https://github.com/BelkaDev/Spotify-Headless) idea/project.


## Features

This CLI app has two modes:
- Interactive, which uses a FZF like [fuzzy finder](https://github.com/ktr0731/go-fuzzyfinder).
    - You can fuzzy find commands, artists, tracks, albuns, etc.

- Unix-like philosophy (still working on this)
    - Allows piping of information.

You can do the same things in both modes.
## Environment Variables

In order to login to your Spotify Account, you will need to set the following Environment Variables:

`USERNAME`

`PASSWORD`
